## What is this?

`llm-wiki-skill` is a Skill running inside Claude Code that ingests raw documents of any format (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, Markdown, images) into a structured Wiki and automatically builds an interactive knowledge graph (`graph.html`).

It implements the knowledge management philosophy proposed by Karpathy: **knowledge is synthesized at ingest time, not query time**. Every time a new document is added, the LLM automatically extracts key points, establishes cross-references, flags contradictions, and updates the synthesis summary — making the knowledge base compound-grow with each ingest.

The core difference from RAG: RAG dumps raw documents into a vector store and assembles answers on-the-fly at query time; `llm-wiki-skill` compiles knowledge into durable wiki pages at ingest time, so queries read already-synthesized conclusions.

## Directory Structure

```
<wiki-root>/
  raw/                  # Raw documents (never modified)
    <topic>/            # Organized by topic, one-level subdirectories
  wiki/
    index.md            # Table of contents for all pages (partitioned by topic)
    overview.md         # Living synthesis across all sources
    log.md              # Append-only operation log
    sources/            # Summary page for each raw document
    entities/           # People / companies / projects / products
    concepts/           # Concepts / frameworks / methodologies
    syntheses/          # Archived query answers
    archive/            # Archived outdated pages
  graph/
    graph.json          # Nodes + edges data
    graph.html          # Self-contained visualization based on vis.js
```

## Command Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `wiki-config workspace <path>` | Set the wiki workspace path |
| `wiki-config show` | View current config and directory status |
| `wiki-input <path> [--topic <slug>]` | Ingest any file path (auto-archives to `raw/<topic>/`) |
| `wiki-ingest <file>` | Ingest a file already in `raw/` |
| `wiki-query: <question>` | Query the knowledge base, synthesize answer |
| `wiki-lint` | Check for orphan pages, broken links, contradictions |
| `wiki-graph` | Build the interactive knowledge graph (`graph.html`) |

**Recommended for daily use: `wiki-input`** — accepts local or remote paths, automatically copies to `raw/<topic>/` before ingesting. No manual management of the `raw/` directory needed.

## Workflow

### Ingest

When ingesting a document, the LLM executes in sequence:

1. Multimodal content extraction (PDF/DOCX/PPTX/XLSX/images → Markdown)
2. Write `wiki/sources/<slug>.md` (summary, key points, key quotes)
3. Update `wiki/index.md` and `wiki/overview.md`
4. Create or update `wiki/entities/` and `wiki/concepts/` pages
5. Flag contradictions with existing content
6. Append operation log to `wiki/log.md`

### Query

Reads `wiki/index.md` to identify relevant pages, synthesizes an answer with inline `[[PageName]]` references. Optionally archives the answer as `wiki/syntheses/<slug>.md`.

### Knowledge Graph

Extracts explicit wikilinks (`EXTRACTED`) and AI-inferred semantic associations (`INFERRED`, confidence ≥ 0.5) between pages, generating a zero-dependency self-contained `graph.html` with node-type coloring and community grouping.

## Supported Formats

| Format | Extraction Method |
|---|---|
| `.md` `.txt` | Direct read |
| `.pdf` | pdfplumber (text + tables) |
| `.docx` | python-docx (body + headings + tables) |
| `.pptx` | python-pptx (titles + body + notes) |
| `.xlsx` `.csv` | pandas (converted to Markdown tables) |
| `.png` `.jpg` `.jpeg` `.webp` `.gif` `.bmp` | Claude vision (multimodal) |

## Multimodal Support

`llm-wiki-skill` uses Claude's native multimodal capability to understand image content — not just OCR, but full semantic comprehension of diagrams, charts, and screenshots.

### Standalone Image Ingestion

Pass any image file directly to `wiki-input` or `wiki-ingest`. Claude reads the image and converts its content to structured Markdown before the standard Ingest workflow runs:

```bash
wiki-input ~/screenshots/architecture-diagram.png --topic system-design
wiki-input ~/photos/whiteboard-session.jpg --topic meetings
```

**What Claude extracts from images:**
- **Charts & graphs** — data series, axis labels, trends, and numerical values
- **Diagrams & flowcharts** — nodes, edges, relationships, and flow direction
- **Screenshots** — UI structure, visible text, and layout context
- **Handwritten notes / whiteboards** — transcribed text and drawn structures
- **Tables in images** — reconstructed as Markdown tables
- **Mixed content** — documents photographed or scanned with both text and figures

### Images Embedded in Documents

When ingesting PDF, DOCX, or PPTX files that contain embedded images, the respective extraction tool captures all text content. Figures and diagrams within those files that are critical to understanding should be re-ingested as standalone images if the text extraction alone is insufficient.

### Supported Image Formats

| Format | Notes |
|---|---|
| `.png` | Lossless; ideal for screenshots, diagrams |
| `.jpg` / `.jpeg` | Photos, scanned documents |
| `.webp` | Web-optimized images |
| `.gif` | First frame is analyzed (static content) |
| `.bmp` | Uncompressed bitmap |

### Multimodal Extraction Pipeline

All image content follows the same Ingest pipeline as text documents — the image is simply converted to Markdown first:

```
Image File
    │
    ▼
Claude Vision (Read tool)
    │  Extracts: text, structure, data, relationships
    ▼
Markdown Description
    │
    ▼
Standard Ingest Workflow (Steps 2–10)
    │  sources/ entities/ concepts/ index/ overview/ log/
    ▼
Wiki Pages + Knowledge Graph
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Set the wiki workspace
wiki-config workspace ~/my-wiki

# 2. Ingest the first document
wiki-input ~/Downloads/paper.pdf --topic papers

# 3. Query
wiki-query: What is the core contribution of this paper?

# 4. Build the knowledge graph
wiki-graph
```
